### 👋 Hey, I’m Hemesh

Product-minded engineer ☕️ | Builder of things | React + AI + two dogs

I love turning ideas into working software — fast. I think in flows, ship iteratively, and lean toward tools that get out of the way so the product can shine. I’m usually knee-deep in a side project, debugging with coffee in hand, or automating something weird with n8n.

### 🛠 Tech I Love Working With

`React` · `Next.js` · `TypeScript` · `Convex` · `Supabase` · `ShadCN`  
`n8n` · `PostHog` · `OpenAI` · `Stripe` · `Whatever Gets It Shipped`
