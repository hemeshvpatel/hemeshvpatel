### 👋 Hey, I’m Hemesh

Product-minded engineer ☕️ | Builder of things | React + AI + two dogs

I love turning ideas into working software — fast. I think in flows, ship iteratively, and lean toward tools that get out of the way so the product can shine. I’m usually knee-deep in a side project, debugging with coffee in hand, or automating something weird with n8n.

### 🚀 Things I’ve Built

- [🧠 ReactStudyKit](https://reactstudykit.com)  
  A learning platform for React devs — with challenges, flashcards, and a custom whiteboard. Built solo from concept to production.

- 🤖 AI + Automation experiments  
  I’m exploring OpenAI, LangChain, and n8n to build automations, agents, and occasionally, chaos — all in the name of productivity.

- 🛠️ Random dev tools  
  If I can scratch my own itch with a tiny app or workflow, I’ll probably build it.
